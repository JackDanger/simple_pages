SimplePages
===========

Allows your app to have a controller full of generic html pages that are served by Rails.

Rather than mix traditional flat-file pages into a Rails app or attempt to create
whole controllers just for a single rhtml view you can now manage pages that act like flat-files
but are editable via a web browser.
